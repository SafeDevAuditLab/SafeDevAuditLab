Hi, I'm SafeDevAuditL

Application Security Engineer | Token Auditing & lifecycle Mgt| | OAuth & API Security | Ethical App Testing etc

Welcome to my profile. I explore how modern applications authenticate, authorize, and protect data. I focus  on OAuth & API Security. Token testing,  and design  application security.
All my work is done in safe, sandboxed environments with strong respect for ethical and legal boundaries.



 What I Do
- Audit **OAuth authorization flows** (PKCE, redirect URIs, state, token exchange)
- Test **API security**, scopes, permissions, and access controls  
- Analyze **token handling**: expiry, rotation, audience, and issuer validation  
- Perform **sandbox bug bounty practice** and responsible disclosure research  
- Document **AppSec methodologies** in clean, reproducible steps  
- Build personal labs like **SafeDevAuditLab** to practice real-world scenarios  

Skills & Focus Areas
**Application Security**  
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect  
- Token lifecycle & JWT analysis  
- Authentication & session handling  
- Consent flows & secure redirect patterns  

**API Security**  
- Role-based access  
- Scope auditing  
- REST & GraphQL security  
- Rate limiting & safe access testing  

**Tools**  
- Browser DevTools  
- Postman  
- Burp Suite  
- JWT.io  
- VS Code
